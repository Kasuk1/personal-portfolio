## General description

This project will be constantly updated with new data and features that I'll constantly learn.

## Documentation

Be sure that the libraries are updated. If not please you can send me a message. I will try my best to give the updated project versioning.

Excute the next lines to install the project locally:

### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies. The project now is built using Vite.

### `npm start`

If everything installed smoothly then run this command to execute `"start": "vite"`. See `package.json` file for more information about the basic configuration of this project.

### `npm run build` & `npm run preview`

The first command will build the production version of the project. The second commanda will show a preview of this.
